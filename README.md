# Purpose

ROOLS is short for roommate-bills. This is a bill management app for roommates built with ReactJS; App will keep track of 4 main bills that are most commonly shared among roommates: Electricity, Gas, Internet, & Rent. A maximum of 3 roommates can be added for each user. Once roommates, and total bill costs are added, contribution for each roommate can be included. A total percentage contribution for each roommate towards the total bill is also automatically calculated and displayed.

Ideas for future development.

1) Add file upload button for each bill.
2) Connect multiple roommate accounts into a group account where all roommates can see the same dashboard.
